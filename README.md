This repository contains a Python Streamlit application for analyzing Eurocopa data, as well as Jupyter Notebooks for scraping and cleaning the data.

I have used fastapi in order to create the endpoints which calls to the data located in a Atlas cloud database.

In this aplication you can see indivials statistics of the selecction whihc played the cup, and also you can see the where all the matches where played. This information  was scraped using  BeautifulSoup library, and for the geolocalitation I used an API provided by Nominatim
